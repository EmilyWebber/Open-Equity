	- compare rates of change per market

would like to understand who is considered "credit-worthy" in each country and why

would like to understand how money is created in each country, how stable is their currency? what does it usually fluctuate with, and how can it be stabilized?

this is one way that a government analysis is fundamentally different from an investor analysis.
	- investors can just move their money if a market is crumbling
	- governemnts have to deal with the people and try to make their lives better
