#FinancialStability

Economies turn. Governments around the world face pressing demands of market changes, currency swings, and uncertain outcomes. For years the US housing market seemed to yield only positive returns, but even though $$$$ of dollars in mortages were securitized and considered AAA, entire generations lost both their future and their past in one tragic 2008 autumn. Inside the US, Baby Boomers approaching retirement lost savings, household spending dropped, business production slumped, and millenials entereed one of the most challenging job markets the US economy has seen since [LAST TIME], leaving them the first generation to expect a lower standard of living than their parents since [LAST TIME]. Outside the US, the European debt crisis triggered an already unstable experiment of political and monetary union without fiscal oversight. Greece almost left the European Union, a surprising British politician successfully pushed his country out of favor with its most important trading partner, and Sterling hit the lowest levels its seen since [LOWEST BRITISH POUND EVER]. What are the implications of these international financial events for policy leaders? How can systemic financial risk be understood as contributing to, deriving from, and interacting with world wide markets? How can data on these markets be better integrated, analyzed, visualized and explained to provide both cutting-edge and foundational insights at the exact moment they are required?

. While some of the immediate conditions that led to the Great Recession were addressed with the Dodd-Frank bill such as [asdasdfasdf], most of the underlying causes such as housing price inflation, uncertain holding positions, and especially [SSSSSS] remain unanswered.

Policy leaders need a tool that can integrate massive amounts of information on systemic financial risk, analyze this data with both well-tested econometric and cutting-edge machine learning algorithms in a manner optimized for runtime, and visualize the results in a framework designed for immediate, reliable, and interpretable insights. Furthermore, policy makers deserve a tool capable of simulating the effect of a given policy on markets

- can simulate effect of policy on market

Financial stability matters. Every year prices on corn, rice,

[keep it about understanding and monitoring systemic risk, not about overcoming income inequality]

Public sector organizations often lack the technical resources needed to fully monitor and respond

Because international financial markets are so highly integrated, the tool best servicing these need
